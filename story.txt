One day Apfelkuchen the Hund was hungry.
He hopped in his Porsche 9/11 Turbo to go grab something to eat. 
He was in the mood for Bratwurst but could only see Brot.
He took a right turn at the Schloss to make his way towards some Döner.
The rotating Döner looked like it was found on the the dirty floor of some Ratskeller.
Instead of eating the Döner, he decided to eat some tasty pretzels at the Biergarten.
Unfortunately, he was chased away by an ill-tempered Hund.
Now that Apfelkucken's appetite was satiated, he was ready for a Berlin Bier.
He put on his best Lederhose and set off for the city.
The gluttonous hound was on the hunt for a Baeckerei.
But he was distracted by a pretty girl in a Dirndel and was hit by a BMW.
And was sent flying through a Ratskeller.
The driver of the BMW was playing Rammstein too loudly so he was distracted and left his klimaanlage on, 
which drained his gas tank and forced him to have to walk down hauptstrasses.
His sight wavered as he thought about the Bratwuerst he never got to eat.
He tried to open the door but the schloss was too strong.
He was then transported to Berlin's Flughafen for an air transport.
When he finally woke up, he was at the Berlin flughafen, with no recollection how he got there and a massive headache.
Suddenly, his ghostly form, robed in a semi-transparent pair of laderhose, lifted out of his body. Oh-no. Is this the afterlife?
